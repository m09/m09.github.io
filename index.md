Hi, I'm [m09][github].
I currently do consulting and professional training as a freelance.
I also enjoy going to and giving talks for the [Nantes Machine Learning Meetup][nmlm] (and co-organize it).

Apart from computer science, I “enjoy” learning about the environmental and societal collapse---the recent field devoted to this transdisciplinary activity is called [collapsology](/collapsology) and I <s>“</s>enjoy<s>”</s> [classical piano][kissin], [old movies][million], [climbing][honnold] and [go][go].

Something to discuss? [Drop me a line](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
